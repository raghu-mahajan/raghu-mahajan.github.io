The presence of Dirichlet walls in the particle in a box problem presents some difficulties and so, for that reason, the particle on a ring is the simplest system with a discrete spectrum that is amenable to a path integral treatment.\nLet \\(x\\) be the coordinate on the ring, which is identified with period \\(2\\pi R\\).
